        "I didn’t move around because I couldn’t keep a job. I moved because I was desperately trying to fix broken systems from the inside. I stepped up into leadership—project management at a corporate franchise, supervisor at Lowe's, trainer at Amazon and Disney—thinking a title would finally give me the power to improve things.",
        "But no matter the role, I hit the exact same wall. I would find the friction, map out a smarter way to operate, and the corporate response was always: 'We want better results, but you can't change the process.'",
        "I realized you can't fix a machine that refuses to evolve. So, I stopped fighting their red tape and built my own workshop.",
        "I am a single mother who built this company, this website, and my software platform simultaneously from the ground up, with zero safety net. I know exactly what it takes to do more with less. Alternative Solutions isn’t just a tech agency. It’s the culmination of everything I’ve learned across a dozen industries, combined with the raw speed of AI development. I build custom, foundational tools for entrepreneurs who just need their systems to actually work, so they can get back to their lives."
